This page was started to take a look at the way typography is used today in branding. How fonts can change *Dove* from body soap to a chocolate bar. Whether big companies need to rely on typeface at all anymore. A brand's whole image is affected by the colour of their title, the slant of their letters, if there's a capital at the start or even an exclamation mark at the end. Typography is a make or break as to whether a company remains a company, or becomes a brand.

The site design was based on the fonts and styles used on college and sports sweatshirts. The bold capital letters are powerful and similar to the design seen on a sports team uniform, and the outline style is supposed to look like the stitching/patch fabric of the letters on a varsity jacket or sweatshirt. The washed-out colours (green and cream) are intended to replicate a vintage style.
